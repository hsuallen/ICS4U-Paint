## Welcome to the paint program tutorial by Allen Hsu!

This is by far the biggest project that Allen has worked on in ICS4U, and it
has been truly successful.

### Tools

+ Pen - great for sketching smaller details, has extremely thin stroke
+ Brush - great for bigger sections of the canvas such as the background colour
+ Eraser - self explanatory
+ Bucket - fills the entire screen up with one solid colour
+ Circle - great for making ellipses or perfect circles
+ Rectangle - great for making rectangles
+ Line - great for making straight lines

### Tool Shortcuts

+ __p__: pen
+ __b__: brush
+ __e__: eraser
+ __g__: bucket
+ __c__: circle
+ __r__: rectangle
+ __l__: line

### Colour Selection

To select a colour, simple right click anywhere on the canvas, and a colour
swatch will pop up; click on one of the colours to select. If want to cancel,
simply click or draw anywhere outside the swatch. To select in gregscale, try
scrolling the mousewheel, and the square on the tool bar below the tools
indicates what the current colour is.

### Brush Size and Stroke Size

To increase the brush size, have pen or brush tool selected, then click on + key
to increase the size, hence the - key to decrease. When have circle, rectangle,
or line tool selected, click on the screen once (where you can freely drag
the shape around), click on the + key to increase the stroke, or the - key to
decrease the stroke.

### Bonus

When drawing shapes, ie circles or retangles, press space to toggle the fill.
